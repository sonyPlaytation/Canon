{$Nils}: Yarn Spinner is a language for writing conversations in games!
{$Nils}: You can use it to write branching dialogue, and use that in a game engine!
{$Gwen}[side=R]: Nils what the fuck are you talking about.
-> Nothing.
    Nils: Oh, man. Maybe you should have.
-> That she was a jerk.
    Nils: Hah! I bet that pissed her off.
    Nils: How'd she react?
    -> She didn't.
        Nils: Booooo. That's boring.
    -> Furiously.
        Nils: That's what I like to hear!
Nils: Anyway, I'd better get going.

{$Nils}: Is that what I look like??|I'm a chubby little skeleton guy? Since when??
{$$}Oh? Were you not always this way?
{$Nils}:... I- I don't know... I don't remember... |I have such foggy memories, but... I'm sure I wasn't always this...
{$Nils}[frame=4]:Why don't I remember anything important??|All I can remember is useless shit like the capital of Canada!!|And where the fuck am I anyway?? Does Ottawa even still exist???"
{$$}Perhaps we can find someone who can help you remember more about yourself...|Though for now it may be best to try and calm yourself.
{$$}Why not take some toilet time to catch your breath?
{$Nils}:Yeah okay... worth a shot I guess."nl"I mean who even knows if I can shit, I doubt I have internal organs anyway...

{$Nils}[frame=1]:Ugh Jesus, my head... I really overslept...|What time is it?
{$narr}Suddenly you notice the state of the room.
{$narr}This may just be the cleanest room ever.|{$narr}The walls are a crisp eggshell, the floor boards look and feel brand new, and the chair you're in feels straight from the factory.
{$narr}For some reason you feel disturbed
{$Nils}[frame=2]:Better question is...
{$Nils}[frame=3]:Where the hell am I??

{$narr}On the cabinet sits a photo of several people at some kind of party.|{$narr}Its placard reads 'FEESE Wrap Party 20XX'.
{$narr}Okay, well, it doesn't actually SAY 20XX, it's just scratched in such a way that you can't make out the last two digits.|{$narr}How inconvenient...
{$narr}Inspect the photo?
    -> Sure
        {$narr}The guy closest to the camera is a middle aged man with a very trendy old man moustache. He looks to be about 60.
        {$narr}He's in the middle of stretching his arms to either side of him, but it's an intensely awkward gesture.|He looks like he was probably wasted, I'd say 81% chance.
        {$narr}Everyone around him seems uncomfortable.
        {$Nils}: Damn, they look like they're having fun...
    -> Nah
        {$narr}What if the photo is of something really important?
        {$Nils}:Nope! Don't care!
        {$narr}...
        {$narr}Okay...|{$narr}You don't look at the photo.

{$narr}You eye the expensive looking desk you woke up in front of.|{$narr}It still looks new, but its surface is marked with several water rings.
    -> Check the drawers
        {$narr}Despite your wimpiest tug, the desks drawers will not budge. 
        {$Nils}[frame=1]:I guess its {$LOCKED}!
        {$Nils}[frame=3]:Aw man... I bet something really useful or cool is in there...
    -> Check the desktop
        {$narr}The desktop is made of a very dark brown wood.
        {$narr}You know Jack from Shit about woodworking so that's the most you can really discern.
        {$Nils}:The perfect arena for a blistering round of solitaire!
        {$Nils}[frame=2]:Not sure why I remember what solitaire is though...
    -> Check nothing
        {$narr}You check nothing... I guess.
        {$Nils}:Stupid nerd desk! I don't even care about your drawer contents or anything!
